# Phaser 3 - Custom Fonts With Native Phaser

![demo](docs/example.png)

A quick demo of how you can easily use custom fonts in Phaser 3 by using the new `FontFile` Loader! This new loader is available in Phaser `3.87.0`, and it has support for `TTF/OTF` out of the box, so you no longer need to use a 3rd party font loader.

For a detailed walkthrough, checkout my video on YouTube here:
