# Phaser 3 - Custom Fonts Demo

![demo](docs/example.png)

A quick demo of how you can easily use custom fonts in Phaser 3 by using the [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader). With the Web Font Loader, you can use your own custom fonts, and use fonts from a provider like Google Fonts.

For a detailed walkthrough, checkout my video on YouTube here:
